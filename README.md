# Hi there 👋
I'm Adiyat, a 2nd year Software Engineering student.

I am always on an adventure to learn new technical skills to add to my skillset!

If there's a project that pops up in my head, I'll make it. I enjoy designing and programming.

## There are two projects I am currently working on 🗂️:

A portfolio website to display my projects, skills and experiences to other people.

A data analytics and neural networking project (General for now, still TBD).

## My experiences in the programming field 🛠️: 

I have used languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP, Python, C++, and Lua!

Some tools/frameworks that I have worked with are Arduino, Node.js, WAMP, Figma, VS Code, and Replit.

### If you want to reach me, I have provided my link tree in my profile!
